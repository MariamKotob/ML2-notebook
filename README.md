# ML2-notebook
Labs I practice during my machine learning internship with InstaDeep LTD. This can be concidered as my Machine Learning Starter.

## Project Overview
In this project I'm going to save all the practice materials and code I write as a part of the internship practical tasks.

## Why This Project
Those practical labs are concidered the base to studying ML. Each of these particular set of labs touches an important topic that must be a surfed by an ML Engineer.

## What Will I learn

## How This Is Proccessed 
Using Google's Colab notebooks for practice and running then saving to this repo.
